                                A pre-paid SIM card will work in any GSM handset that is not
                                network-locked. If your handset was subsidised by your network 
                                operator, it may be network-locked â€“ i.e. restricted to that
                                particular cellular network. Please contact your cellular service 
                                provider or network operator and ask if your phone is network-locked. 
                                If it is locked, they may be able to unlock it. A foreign pre-paid 
                                SIM card will NOT work in a network-locked phone.

                            </span>

                                No, you do not require international roaming! The point of purchasing 
                                a pre-paid SIM card is to avoid international roaming costs and constraints

                                <p>The SIM card manual and your handset manual will have detailed instructions on how to insert and activate your SIM card. In general, the procedure is as follows:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Remove the SIM card from its packaging and protective plastic frame.</li>
                                    <li>Insert the card into your handset as indicated in the handset manual.</li>
                                    <li>Turn on the handset.</li>
                                    <li>You may be prompted to enter a PIN code. This code may be found on the SIM envelope or in the SIM user manual. (More about PIN and PUK codes below).</li>
                                    <li>In a few moments your handset will acquire the mobile network and be ready for use.</li>

                                    The SIM card will only work when you are in the country for which it has been sold, 
                                    and when you are within network coverage.

                                    <li>
                                        The PUK, or PIN Unlock Key, is another code which is used 
                                        in the event of your handset being locked by the repeated entry 
                                        of an incorrect PIN code.Both codes are entered into your handset as required.

                                        Both the PIN code and the PUK code are included with your SIM card and should 
                                        be kept safe in case they are needed. These numbers will typically be printed on
                                        the SIM envelope or in the SIM user manual.

                                <p>Mobile Zone has negotiated preferential international rates with 012 Smile, one of Israel's leading international carriers. To access the discounted rates when calling internationally, dial 012 - country code - phone number.<br>
                                    For example: to call SA, dial 012-27-82-123-4567 or 012-27-11-888-1234 where 27 is the country code; to call the US dial 012-1-555-123-4567 where 1 is the country code.</p>
                                <p>International rates vary according to destination and time of day (peak or off-peak; holiday or work day). The deal Mobile Zone has with 012 generally offers the cheapest dialing option to most destinations. For further information on international calling via 012 Smile, please eMail <a href="mailto:support@012.net">support@012.net</a> or visit <a href="http://www.012.net" target="_blank">www.012.net</a></p>

                                    <li>The 012 prefix must NOT BE USED when sending SMS, which should be addressed in the usual format - e.g. +27-82-123-4567</li>

In this case, rates are determined by Orange. More details on calling rates can be obtained from an Orange customer service representative by calling *111 and then pressing 0.</li>

                                Your SIM card will be active for one year from date of last use. If your card has been 
                                inactive for longer than a year, the number may be suspended and the card may no longer
                                work. Note: this period is subject to change by the local network operator, without notice.

                                regardless of whether incoming calls have been received during this period. Note: this

                                MobileZone accepts payment via PayPal, including payments made by credit or debit card.
                                However, in the case that you don't have a PayPal account, you may still be able to pay 
                                for your purchase with a credit or debit card using PayPal's Guest Checkout service.
                                When you are ready to check out, click the "Checkout" button. You'll notice the credit 
                                card logos next to the PayPal
                                logo because credit card payments can also be processed through PayPal. You'll be taken
                                to a secure page on PayPal. Look for a link below the log-in form reading Don't have a PayPal 
                                account? You'll then be prompted to fill in your billing and credit card information. You will 
                                be given the option to create a PayPal account, but you can decline that offer and continue your 
                                payment.

                                valid credit or debit card to follow our easy to use 3 Step process.

                                Most cellular companies, including T-Mobile and Cingular Wireless, will unlock your phone for
                                you if you have been an existing customer for at least 3 months. If your provider refuses to 
                                unlock your phone, there are services on ebay that will do it for you.
